## Data Overview  

Each parquet file contains ~19 columns and around 2.9 million records per month.  
Some columns include missing values (e.g., passenger_count, RatecodeID).  

Data quality issues handled:  
- Missing values addressed during data cleaning.  
- Outliers (e.g., negative fares or extreme trip distances) treated as well.
